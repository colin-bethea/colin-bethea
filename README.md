- 👨🏼‍💻 I'm a software engineer and technical lead. If you're in the Bay Area and want to grab a coffee, hit me up.

- 💬 Feel free to ask me about engineering, product design, monkeys, amateur chess, or deciding to not go to college.

- 🛠 Before joining Candor, I worked at <a href=https://synthate.com target="blank">Synthate</a>, built <a href=https://www.athenify.com target="blank">Athenify</a> and <a href=https://www.joinstratagem.com target="blank">Stratagem</a>, did research work for a VC firm, and obsessed too much over video games.
