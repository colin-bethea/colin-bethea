### Hey, I'm Colin and I build software/products.

* Resources for stalking me on the web:
  * I write and ramble on my own [corner of the internet](https://www.colinbethea.com/).
  * I'm a huge fan of [monkeys](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/emperor-tamarin), [climbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcRBT9Q9jXM), and [reading](https://www.colinbethea.com/bookshelf).
  * Send me a note at colinjbethea [at] gmail [dot] com (begone, bots).
