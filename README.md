Hey, I'm Colin and I type for a living. 

Stalk me on the interwebs:
- I work at a [super secret big tech company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
- I write and ramble on my own [corner of the internet](https://www.colinbethea.com/).
- I'm a huge fan of [monkeys](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/emperor-tamarin), [climbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcRBT9Q9jXM), and [reading](https://www.colinbethea.com/bookshelf).
